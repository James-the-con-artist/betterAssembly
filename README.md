Top buttons:
Volunteering Opportunities: Displays the opportunities that are currently available. There can also be Duke Of Edinborough info

    Sports: Displays information such as the tryout times, team roster, and anything else that the team captains or the coaches wish to display (epic plays etc.) and also information from Figgs about scorekeeping that we also get emails about but never look at

    Academic Info: I am not sure if I actually want this here because this page won't be filled that easily. This is because information varies a lot between grades. We could create even more subcategories for different grades but then we would need each grade to be responsible for their own page and that would be a bit difficult right now.

    Clubs: Info about all clubs. Each club can have a card (a card is like what is drawn on the front of the website) and this card can display images about what it is like to be in that club, meeting times, contact info, etc.

    Staff: Long list of the staff and faculty of the school; again, don't really know if I want this here because there.

    About us: Your normal about us page like on any other website. If we end up making this a club we can display our info about how to join, who to contact etc.
    
Other Info:
I still need to figure out what to put on the area that says "Something here". I haven't found a useful thing to put there but this is also the very first design. I think "The Saints Bulletin" is a nice name for the entire thing but if you have any other ideas feel free to tell us.

Each card on the main page will consist of announcements that are made by everyone. These announcements, unless made by some super high authority, will require review before put onto the site to prevent random stuff appearing for no reason.
